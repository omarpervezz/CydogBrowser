Our proxy provider for these needs is Cloudflare. Cloudflare uses a framework called strictly necessary cookies to limit your web footprint. This website contains only one cookie and it is the Cloudflare cookie. We are hosted through GitHub Pages so we can only serve static content with no server-side analytics whatsoever. GitHub "may collect User Personal Information from visitors to your GitHub Pages website, including logs of visitor IP addresses, to comply with legal obligations, and to maintain the security and integrity of the Website and the Service." <br></br> Our <strong>website analytics for non-security related activity</strong> is done through Google Analytics.</p>
                              <p class="more_information">More information about Cloudflare's cookie usage and your privacy is available <a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/cookie-policy/" class="global_btn"> here.</a></p>
