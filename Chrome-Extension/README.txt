Description: 
This is a playful chrome extension. Our official ones are available on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari. Cydog Browser likes to use dedicated software distribution systems to increase trust in using our tech. When you download from a store like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari, they have pre-reviewed our code for quality control and assurance to ensure it is not malicious. This decreases the potential for code-related abuses, even while it does centralize power in the hands of a few big companies. Its a trade-off we are more than willing to make to ensure you feel comfortable with our software and applications. 

This extension does not offer features you will get from our extensions listed on the Chrome, Firefox, and Safari stores. Instead, it will provide quick access to websites related to Cydog Browser, including our Cydog Intensifies feature. This Toolkit probably wouldn’t make it through the review process on those stores because it doesn’t have many features. It is not meant to. It is meant to be low footprint code, using as few browser “permissions” as possible, for those of you who do not like high impact code with sensitive permissions on your browser. It also makes it more convenience to get to our goods and services. We hope you enjoy!
